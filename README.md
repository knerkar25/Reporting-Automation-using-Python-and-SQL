# Transform Your Data into Stunning PDF Reports with Python and SQL.

In this project I have used Python and SQL to transform your data into PDF reports.

First, I have set up a SQLite database and load sample data into it using Python. Next, I have used SQL queries to extract the data you need from the database. Then, I used Pandas to manipulate and transform the data, and show you how to create interactive charts with Plotly Express.

Once my data prepped and ready, I'll use the FPDF library to generate a PDF report.
